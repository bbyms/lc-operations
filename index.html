        <h1>Bangladesh</h1>

        <p>In August 2017, within the space of a single month, 500,000 Rohingya people fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state seeking safety in Bangladesh. After one year, it is estimated that the number of new arrivals has risen to 720,000 people. Humanitarian organisations operating in Cox’s Bazar, in support of the government-led response, currently target 1.3 million people for humanitarian assistance, including host communities in the area. </p>

        <p>Since the start of its operation in Bangladesh, the Logistics Sector has been acting as a coordination mechanism supporting over sixty humanitarian organisations and government institutions with critical common services and key logistics information, including access constrains maps. </p>

        <p>While working on the immediate response, the Logistics Sector has also been supporting organisations with their preparedness activities. The exposure to natural hazards, including heavy rains during monsoon and cyclone seasons which cause flooding and infrastructure damage, coupled with the temporary nature of many settlements and shelters represent a continuous challenge to the humanitarian logistics operations. Year-round preparedness is therefore necessary. </p>

        <p>In close collaboration with humanitarian partners, the Logistics Sector has facilitated the establishment of free-to-user storage space in three logistics hubs in Cox’s Bazar: Ukhiya and Madhu Chara, both provided by WFP, and Teknaf, managed by Handicap International/Atlas Logistique. In total, 18 MSUs have been made available as common storage for the humanitarian community. </p>

        <img src="images/bangladesh.jpg" class="align-left slide-in">

        <p>Since the start of the operation in September 2017, the Logistics Sector has coordinated storage of XX m3 of relief items, including more than two million soap bars and 250,000 blankets, for XX different actors such as national and international NGOs, and UN agencies. </p>

        <p>The common facilities have also been used to preposition relief items for the monsoon season preparation plans and further support has been provided by loaning 20 containers in several locations for the storage of rapid response goods.</p>

        <p>In parallel, the Logistics Sector has been advocating with authorities for the implementation of procedures, such as truck weight limits, to ensure road access is maintained and relief cargo can reach key locations within and around the camps and makeshift settlements.  </p>

        <p>In addition, WFP and Better Shelter led two training courses, with a total of 28 participants from 13 organisations, on the topics of warehouse management and assembly of prefabricated shelters, to strengthen the capacity of actors on the ground.</p>

        <p>The operating environment remains extremely variable. Adaptive coordination, effective assessment and information management activities, as well as a focus on resilience and capacity building are critical going into 2019. The Logistics Sector is working with partners to review its support and to define the scale up that may be required in case of a cyclone affecting Cox’s Bazar.</p>

        <h1>Central African Republic</h1>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster is active in Central African Republic since 2013, in support of the humanitarian community. Significant logistics constraints, poor infrastructure and the fragile security context, make it difficult for humanitarian assistance to reach the beneficiaries.
        </p>
        <p>
          To overcome logistics constraints and ensure the efficient delivery of humanitarian aid, the Logistics Cluster coordinates a logistics platform providing common transport and storage services. These services are managed by different organisations based on their capacity and presence on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Road transport of relief items from Bangui, Bambari and Bossangoa is led by Humanity and Inclusion. Première Urgence Internationale is in charge of storage in Bangui, while Solidarités International and Humanity and Inclusion manage mobile storage units loaned from WFP in Kaga Bandoro, Bambari and Bossangoa.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2018 (as of 31 October), <strong>XXX</strong> m<sup>3</sup> have been transported and <strong>XXX</strong> m<sup>3</sup> have been stored across the common facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster has also been facilitating a common air cargo service, managed by WFP, to deliver life-saving items in hard-to-access areas such as Bangassou, Zemio, Obo, Alindao and Bria. As of 31 October <strong>XXX</strong>, rotations were performed with <strong>XXX</strong> m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian aid to <strong>XXX</strong> locations. To expediate delivery of emergency cargo in hard-to-reach locations, the Logistics Cluster and UNHAS have been working to identify the airstrips needing rehabilitation and have been coordinating the necessary works with Humanity and Inclusion and the local authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transport to hard-reach locations is integrated with common storage space. As of October 2018, two mobile storage units are being deployed to Zemio and Alindao to be managed by ACTED and Action Contre la Faim, respectively. The MSUs have been transported to the targeted locations and are expected to become operational by November 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
          By December 2018, the Logistics Cluster will also start providing support to some infrastructure rehabilitation projects, which are crucial in improving logistics operations, and the overall delivery of humanitarian assistance to the affected population. These projects, implemented by ACTED, will be targeting broken bridges and will have a duration of nine months.

        <h1>Lybia</h1>
        <p>
          Libya has faced six years of political instability, conflict and insecurity, alongside a deteriorating public sector and economy, and prospects remain uncertain in the medium and long term.
        </p>
        <p>
          In August 2018, fighting in Tripoli led to a new wave of displacement and the ceasefire agreement reached on 4 September remains fragile, with reports of several violations. Violent clashes may continue to erupt throughout the country in the lead-up to the planned December presidential elections.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is estimated that 1.6 million people have been impacted by the crisis so far, with approximately 800,000 in urgent need of humanitarian assistance throughout 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the deteriorating situation inside Libya and following the lifting in February of the evacuation status for UN organisations, humanitarian actors have started relocating back to Libya and scaling up their presence into previously inaccessible areas to respond to the growing humanitarian needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Logistics Sector Coordinator has been deployed in country to provide logistics coordination and information management support to the responding organisations. Regular coordination meetings will be held in Tunis and Tripoli, according to the security situation on the ground and organisations presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mapping and assessment of the logistics infrastructure such as access roads, airports, ports, border crossings, and the compilation of guidance and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on customs and clearance procedures are some of the activities envisaged to enhance the overall predictability, timeliness and efficiency of the logistics response.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, to support increasing humanitarian operations within the country and to allow for pre-positioning of stocks, common storage facilities need to be promptly established, especially in the main hubs of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Sebha.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A project proposal and Concept of Operations are being finalised to reflect these immediate needs and donors are being approached to cover the funding requirements.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector has reached to a number of humanitarian organisations operating across Libya, held a first coordination meeting attended by thirteen organisations, launched a dedicated webpage, set up a mailing list, and will continue to work to enhance information sharing and coordination among all the actors, both national and international, with a focus on identifying gaps and bottlenecks specific to the different areas covered by humanitarian assistance to ensure the best use of available resource and to avoid duplication of efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Major challenges will continue to be related to security and access constraints and the volatile context that requires a flexible operational approach and response capacity to adapt to the needs of the humanitarian community.

        <h1>South Sudan</h1>
        <p>
          Ongoing insecurity in conjunction with an extremely poor transport infrastructure have left humanitarian responders in South Sudan with limited options to deliver lifesaving cargo to the displaced populations scattered across the country. The Logistics Clusters facilitates a range of common services aimed at ensuring the effective delivery of humanitarian aid to the affected population.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 31 October, The Logistics Cluster, working closely with OCHA and WFP Access Units, coordinated <strong>XX convoys</strong> on behalf of the humanitarian community. The convoy schedule has been significantly increased between month and month to maximises the use of the roads during the dry season and facilitate prepositioning in areas that are hard to reach or even cut off during the rainy season.
        </p>
        <p>
          To complement transportation services, WFP, as the lead of the Logistics Cluster, has made available to the humanitarian community common storage warehouses in several locations across the country and provided MSUs for the strategic prepositioning of relief items based on organisations’ needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the access issues, exacerbated during the rainy season, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates air transport to priority locations with dedicated assets, made available by WFP Aviation, bringing large quantities of relief cargo to hard-to-reach locations. From January to October this year, approximately <strong>XX</strong> m<sup>3</sup> of cargo has been delivered to various locations in South Sudan. Air services are complimented by IOM Common Transport Services which provides shunting services to and from the airstrips along with one-day transport to access close sites, as part of the Beyond Wau and Beyond Bentiu responses.
        </p>

        <img src="images/SSD.JPG" class="align-right slide-in">

        <p>
          Finally, river transport via barge is made available to humanitarian responders to move larger payloads of NFIs. As of 31 October, <strong>XX</strong> m<sup>3</sup> of relief items have been transported on the Nile river.
        </p>
        <p>
          South Sudan is a large-scale operation with several complexities, nevertheless the Logistics Cluster has been active in the country for several years and these services run effectively providing valuable support to the humanitarian operations in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this year, South Sudan had to face a new challenge ensuing the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo which exposes the country to a significant risk of transmission. An Ebola Preparedness Task Force has been therefore established by the Ministry of Health to be prepared to tackle an epidemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Acting as the focal point for WFP South Sudan in Ebola Preparedness, the Logistics Cluster is taking an active role in the Task Force, supporting health partners in mapping border screening centers along with the capacities of the organisations present in Western and Central Equatoria, the locations identified as first priority.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cluster also scaled up the coordination of transport of Ebola related material and has been working with WFP Country Office and sub-offices to coordinate the Advanced Preparedness Actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regional preparedness activities have also been supported by the cluster, who recently deployed one staff in Uganda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking towards 2019, the Logistics Cluster aims at ensuring continuity and reliability in the services made available to the humanitarian community in South Sudan in a context of positive change. By trying to reduce the reliance on air transport movements through the reinforcement of road transport and the expansion of the river network for pre-positioning activities. The cluster will work to ensure the effectiveness and the efficiency of this unique humanitarian response.

        <h1>Syria</h1>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster was activated in Syria in January 2013, in order to facilitate access to crucial logistics services for all operations across the region, including surface transportation, contingency fuel provision and storage, cross-border transhipment services, emergency airlifts, and warehousing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 2014, the Whole of Syria (WoS) approach was adopted as a result of the UN Security Council Resolution 2165, bringing together regional separate operations (Jordan, Syria, Turkey and as of 2018 Iraq) into a single framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster provides coordination support for cross-border operations and transhipment services from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan. In Jordan, the service was provided until June 2018, with transhipment and transport into southern Syria was managed by IOM at Ar-Ramtha crossing point. In Turkey and in Iraq transhipment is managed by WFP, at the crossing points of Bab al Hawa and Bab al Salam and of Al Yaroubiyah.
        </p>
        <img src="images/MSU_Syria.jpg" class="align-left slide-in">
        <p>
          <strong>So far in 2018, a total of XX trucks have been coordinated for transhipment services. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Within Syria, common transport and storage services are provided to the humanitarian community. Together with OCHA and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), the Logistics Cluster has been coordinating Inter-Agency humanitarian convoys to hard-to-reach locations and besieged areas and facilitating access to free-to-user transport to Qamishli, Deir-ez-Zor, East Ghouta, and other newly-accessible areas using WFP assets. XX humanitarian convoys have been coordinated this year as of 31 October.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making use of WFP warehouses in Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Qamishli, Rural Damascus and Tartous, the Logistics Cluster has been coordinating the prepositioning of inter-agency cargo, as well as the temporary storage of relief items before onward movement to further destinations and distribution points.  <strong>So far in 2018, a total of XX m3 have been stored in these common warehouses.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure the effective coordination of a complex response that extend over three countries, with all the complications of border crossing and different custom regulations, the Logistics Cluster has been holding regular coordination meetings in Damascus, Amman, Gaziantep and Antakya and has been organising trainings across the Whole of Syria countries to enhance the capacity of humanitarian responders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, the Logistics Cluster plans to expand its capacity building role, both continuing to organise logistical trainings as well as providing crucial logistical assets to enable the humanitarian community to better support vulnerable populations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster will continue to facilitate access to logistics services across the WoS, with a focus on newly-accessible areas. A strong regional information management and coordination system will be maintained to ensure a harmonised response across the three countries.
